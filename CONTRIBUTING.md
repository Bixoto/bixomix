# Contributing to Bixomix

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Bixomix.

We don’t accept new mixins because we only want to have code that we actually use, but you can contribute in fixing bugs
or adding tests. These mixins are extracted from our production code, which is heavily tested, but we haven’t taken the
time to add all the tests in this repository yet.
